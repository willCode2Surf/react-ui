# reactjs-ui
ReactJS UI Components

# what this is
This is a simple repo to build out some simple, very modular ReactJS components. 

# what this is not
Parts of this repo may or may not be something you can use in production.  As of now there is no mass adoption of the Flux pattern and you might even see some JQuery syntax sprinkled in.  These components are being built with real world usage and reuse in mind.

# how to use this repo

1.  npm install
2.  gulp

This repo makes use of gulp to concat, lint, and built a minified version.  The gulp command will do a few things if you do not provide a command line variable.  For constant/develop efforts it is recommended to run 

gulp dev

# road map
Some things to expect if using or reviewing this repo.

* migration to a webpack approach with widgets
* travis build integration, npm module soon
* a component roadmap coming soon.  we are starting with the lowest level components and building more comprehensive components on top of those, constantly refactoring as needed.

# contribute or ideas?
yes please.  this is my first ReactJS repo and I would love feedback and assistance.  I hate finding repos that serve as a poor example or don't do a framework justice.
